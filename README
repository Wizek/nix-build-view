# motivation

this is an interactive showcase how nix-build could be extended for better usability

1. type 'make'
2. run './demo'

or 

on a linux shell do:
 
    cat preview

# todo

* look at: 'nixos-rebuild build -Q', why does it look so nice?

* find out what features i can do:

    * total download size known?
    * bandwidth per download known?
    * summary of all download bandwidths known?

* find out how downloads are started when doing 'nixos-rebuild switch' -> nix-build 

* what drives the main loop in 'nix-build'
  nix-store binary (nix-store.c) calls void run(..) -> opRealise(..) -> store->buildPaths(..) -> (build.cc) -> void Worker::run(const Goals & _topGoals) is the main loop!

* find a nice output wrapper, preferably a singleton which wraps printMsg() somehow

    * how does nix-build write to the shell
    
        it uses libutil/util.cc's:
        printMsg() -> printMsg_() -> writeToStderr(s) -> _writeToStderr() -> defaultWriteToStderr(..) -> writeFull(..) -> write(..)

    * how to integrate the WINCH (signal 28) terminal signal which is thrown on console resize?

        probably using a FD which the sinal handler writes to

    * how to extenda ./scripts/download-from-binary-cache.pl.in to read status

* design phase

    * [done] design a multiline prototype -> see demo.cpp
    * single line prototype (wanted by eelco)
