# motivation

this is an interactive showcase how nix-build could be extended for better usability using a GUI based on ncurses.

# outstanding ideas

i wanted to have colored widgets thus i had to write my own WindowManager and i added my own AdvancedString implementation. 
please feel free to copy from my work!

# how to get this running

 1. cd nix-build-view
 2. nix-shell -p ncurses
 3. make
 4. ./nix-build-view
